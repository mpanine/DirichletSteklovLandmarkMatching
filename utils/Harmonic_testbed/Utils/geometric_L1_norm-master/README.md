# Consistent Discretization and Minimization of the L1 Norm on Manifolds
[[Arxiv]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.05434)

Evaluation code for Consistent Discretization and Minimization of the L1 Norm on Manifolds.
This code demonstrate the computation and minimization of the 1st order approximation of the L1 norm defined over triangulated meshes.
As a case study, it computes the Compressed Manifold Modes of a shape, regularized by the proposed norm.
